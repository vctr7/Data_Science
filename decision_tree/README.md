## 3.	Instructions for compiling source codes 

Since I use Python, it has subtle differnece with [instruction](https://github.com/vctr7/Data_Science/blob/master/apriori_algorithm/apriori.pdf).

    python3 dt.py (train_file.txt) (test_file.txt) (output_file.txt)



(Python3 version : 3.7.3)
 



## 4.	Any other specification of implementation and testing
None.
